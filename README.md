Purpose: The purpose of this app is to help users find services for developmentally disabled people; whether it is themselves or their loved ones.

Motivation: My cousin is in the low spectrum of autism and I also have worked very closely with developmentally disabled population for over 2 years. I know how heartbreaking it is to see someone not reaching their full potential because they lacked the knowledge. I created this app and plan on making it a full fletched thing so that New Yorkers can take advantage of the great, free resources our state has to offer.

Software used: Android Studio

Interface-So far the app includes

1. Landing page
2. Branching in next page
3. Information about different services and terms
4. Search page
5. Result page

Future plans:

1. Onboarding screen design instead of landing page
2. Fully populated information page
3. Properly implemented Search engine to map to SQL database
4. SQL database to store result for the search query
5. Using google place API to make the search results more personal
